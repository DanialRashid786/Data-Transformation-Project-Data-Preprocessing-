## Transformations Applied
1. **Normalization:** Adjusting the values of numeric columns to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.
2. **Standardization:** Transforming data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
4. **aggregation:** Perform some aggregation on dataset
5. **Discretization:** Perform Discretization on dataset
6. **Binning**: Binning the 'Age' feature into categories.
## Installation and Usage
To run the transformations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DanialRashid786/Data-Transformation-Project-Data-Preprocessing-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-transformation-project
    ```
5. Open the `data_transformation.ipynb` Jupiter notebook and run the cells to see the transformations applied.
